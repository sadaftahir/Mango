I would like to share my e-commerce website which I have created using PHP and MongoDB.

If you would like to make any contributions, provide feedback or even use the website as for your own projects and businesses then please feel free to do so with permission.

To get you started you need to do the following things:
  XAMPP and MongoDB must be installed. 
  You should be able to run Apache and MongoDB. 
  In MongoDB you have to setup your own database in order to run the website. 

KeyPoints:
  •	Full Responsive
  •	MongoDb Database
  •	Customers add items to a basket and enter their personal details (name, address, email, telephone number, etc.).  
  •	The front end is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  •	Server-side scripts are written in PHP.
  •	A content management system (CMS) enables staff to add products, view orders, etc.

How to Navigate in Admin
In the browser's address bar, type localhost/store/admin;

Please feel free to report an Issue or ask for a feature that you want to see in this project or a Pull Request would be welcome.
